R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X with R 3.1.3 and R development version, Ubuntu running 
on Travis-CI, and Win builder.

I see two notes in R CMD CHECK. One is about rCharts, which is not on CRAN, but I point out where to obtain it in the Description field of the DESCRIPTION file. Another note points out possibly mis-spelled words, which are not mis-spelled. 

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
