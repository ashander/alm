Title: Client for the 'Lagotto' 'Altmetrics' Platform
Description: An R interface to the open source article level metrics platform
    <https://github.com/articlemetrics/lagotto/> created by the Public Library
    of Science ('PLOS'). A number of publishers are using the open source 'app'
    created by 'PLOS', so you can drop in a different base URL to the functions
    in this package to get to not only 'PLOS' data, but data for 'Crossref',
    and more as the open source 'PLOS' software is used.
