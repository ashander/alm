Title: R Client for the Lagotto Altmetrics API Platform.
Description: An R interface to the open source article level metrics API
    created by the Public Library of Science (PLOS). A number of publishers are
    using the open source app created by PLOS, so you can drop in a different
    base URL to the functions in this package to get to not only PLOS data, but
    data for Crossref, and more as the open source PLOS software is used.
